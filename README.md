## About
As far as you know, a lot of universities uses the "ПС-Розклад" system to share schedule among the students.
It's really good when you're the user, not developer. Many developers/students want to use schedule from mentioned 
resource to build more useful/powerful interfaces, such as mobile apps, telegram bots, etc.  
But there's no API. **So this library will solve this problem..**
